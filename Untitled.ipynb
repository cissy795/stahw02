First Extension: Character-Specific Markov Chains: The code was modified to build a Markov chain based on individual characters rather than words. We discussed how the chain operates at the character level, leading to less coherent text outputs that mimic character patterns but may not form valid words or sentences. Second Extension: Bigram-Based Markov Chains:This extension introduced bigrams (pairs of words) to the Markov chain, allowing the chatbot to generate text based on two-word dependencies. We analyzed how this improves the coherence and grammatical structure of the generated sentences compared to single-word dependency chains. Through this interaction, we explored the differences in how each extension affects text generation, noting that the character-specific model leads to less structured text, while the bigram model enhances sentence fluency."
